2	I am happy with the success of LLMs, but I am not much of a NLP fan. What do you think will be the next big thing that will achieve commercial success or wide range of applicability (useful both in startups and large companies)?    E.g., are RL or GNNs going to start being used in practice more widely (I know GNNs are used in large companies, but still I am not aware that they are widely used)?I consider computer vision a well established field considering practical applications, but is there maybe something new happening there?	reddit
3	1. Here's a link to the Project Page: https://zkf1997.github.io/DART/2. Here's a link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/html/2410.05260v13. Here's My Question: I'm trying to recreate this paper in the form of a browser based app for me to play around with. Where would I find the motion data and text annotations necessary to train the VAE?	reddit
4	Hey everyone,I'm looking to deploy [this model](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli) (mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli) on-premise and need some advice on the hardware requirements (GPU, CPU, RAM, etc.).* Has anyone deployed this model locally or have recommendations for the minimum hardware setup (especially for GPU/VRAM requirements)?* What would be the recommended specs for efficient performance and fine-tuning tasks?Additionally, I'm curious about the general process to figure out hardware requirements for models like this. How do you typically approach determining the necessary hardware for deploying transformer models in local environments?Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!	reddit
5	Hello,For those of yall knowledgeable in the mixture of experts literature, what are some papers that route to a single expert? Furthermore, most papers evenly distribute the workload across experts (or try to). Are there papers on methods where a specific expert is the correct choice? e.g. we donâ€™t necessarily need equal workload distribution acrosss experts 	reddit

7	Hi. Anyone worked with open-metric learning and image retrieval?I could really use your help. I've tried dinov2 embeddings and its failed to retrieve for like 10/100 cases. So I'm trying to finetune a model on my dataset to get good embeddings. But here's the problem: IDONTHAVELABELS. NO LABELS.I need to train model just on images and get the embedding. I've tried ViT, CLIP, ResNet, Inception. Dinov2 was the best, clip came second (top 5 similar image wise). And its not possible to finetune dinov2 because meta haven't released their model weights, just the model backbone. So that was a dead end. I was looking into Metric learning, and trying to bring images closer together, OML, which still needed labels. So I was looking into self taught metric learning without labels (A CVPR 2021) but that architecture caused me an error. When we have to finetune models, labels come into play, and I don't have any labels. Before you tell me to caption my dataset, I've already tried that using BLIP-2. My images are very specific and abstract, blip2 hallucinated most of the captions and got most of them wrong. To finetune blip2 on my dataset I need to buy an external gpu since the model is huge and can't be supported on google colab pro. That also was a dead end. Please help me. I'm trying to build a robust image retreiver	reddit
8	..or was there an LLM training logbook of sorts shared by Google Brain researchers which detailed all the experiments they did, and the approaches they tried while training an LLM? I distinctly remember seeing such a project up on GitHub but it's nowhere to be seen now ! It was meant as a sort of guide for anyone setting out to train an LLM to avoid common pitfalls and such.It might not have been google specifically though.Am I dreaming ?(Edit: more context) 	reddit
9	1. What would you recommend someone moving from academia to join an industry research lab do in their first 30, 90, and 180 days to ensure they are making a good contribution to the company?2. Are there habits or ways of thinking in academia which you need to actively move away from/manage in industry research environments?3. In general, what skills are most commonly lacking or weak in employees coming from academia and/or which skills should an academic brush up/learn on before joining a company?4. Any other tips/advice?	reddit
10	"It is assumed that, in the primordial plasma, at the temperatures above the
mass of electron, fermions are in the neutral state being the superposition of
particle and antiparticle. There exists neutral proton-electron symmetry.
Proton-electron equilibrium is defined by the proton-electron mass difference.
At the temperature equal to the mass of electron, pairs of neutral electrons
annihilate into photons, and pairs of neutral protons and electrons survive as
protons and electrons."	arxiv
11	"The use of the existing proton storage rings combined with electron linear
accelerator as a ring-linac type electron-proton or photon-proton collider is
investigated. The total CM-energy of Proton-ring and Electron-linac Collider
(PRELC) is in the range of 1.0 TeV. The most important physical issues are
listed and the most critical machine aspects of the PRELC are studied. It is
shown that the luminosities in the range of $10^{31}$ to $10^{32}$ could be
achieved. The PRELC could be used simultaneously with the $e^+e^-$-collider if
the refocused electron beam could be used as the electron beam for the PRELC."	arxiv
12	"Multicomponent density functional theory (DFT) enables the consistent quantum
mechanical treatment of both electrons and protons. A major challenge has been
the design of electron-proton correlation functionals that produce even
qualitatively accurate proton densities. Herein an electron-proton correlation
functional, epc17, is derived analogously to the Colle-Salvetti formalism for
electron correlation and is implemented within the nuclear-electronic orbital
(NEO) framework. The NEO-DFT/epc17 method produces accurate proton densities
efficiently and is promising for diverse applications."	arxiv
13	"Scenario of baryogenesis is considered in which primordial plasma starting
from the Planck scale consists of primordial particles being the precursors of
electrons and clusters of particles being the precursors of protons.
Equilibrium between the precursors of protons and the precursors of electrons
is defined by the proton-electron mass difference. At the temperature equal to
the mass of electron, primordial particles transit into protons, electrons,
photons."	arxiv
14	"Binary mixtures of electrons with protons and of electrons with photons
subjected to external electromagnetic fields are analyzed by using the Anderson

determined as well as general expressions for the electrical and thermal
conductivities for relativistic ionized gas mixtures. Explicit expressions for
the transport coefficients are given for the particular cases: a
non-relativistic mixture of protons and non-degenerate electrons; an
ultra-relativistic mixture of photons and non-degenerate electrons; a
non-relativistic mixture of protons and completely degenerate electrons; an
ultra-relativistic mixture of photons and completely degenerate electrons and a

15	"Shuttle-assisted charge transfer is pivotal for the efficient energy
transduction from the food-stuff electrons to protons in the respiratory chain
of animal cells and bacteria. The respiratory chain consists of four
metalloprotein Complexes (I-IV) embedded in the inner membrane of a
mitochondrion. Three of these complexes pump protons across the membrane,
fuelled by the energy of food-stuff electrons. Despite extensive biochemical
and biophysical studies, the physical mechanism of this proton pumping is still
not well understood. Here we present a nanoelectromechanical model of the
electron-driven proton pump related to the second loop of the respiratory
chain, where a lipid-soluble ubiquinone molecule shuttles between the Complex I
and Complex III, carrying two electrons and two protons. We show that the
energy of electrons can be converted to the transmembrane proton potential
gradient via the electrostatic interaction between electrons and protons on the
shuttle. We find that the system can operate either as a proton pump, or, in
the reverse regime, as an electron pump. For membranes with various
viscosities, we demonstrate that the uphill proton current peaks near the body
temperature $T \approx 37 ^{\circ}$C."	arxiv
16	"Proton mirror modes are large amplitude nonpropagating structures frequently
observed in the magnetosheath. It has been suggested that electron temperature
anisotropy can enhance the proton mirror instability growth rate while leaving
the proton cyclotron instability largely unaffected, therefore causing the
proton mirror instability to dominate the proton cyclotron instability in
Earth's magnetosheath. Here, we use particle-in-cell simulations to investigate
the electron temperature anisotropy effects on proton mirror instability
evolution. Contrary to the hypothesis, electron temperature anisotropy leads to
excitement of the electron whistler instability. Our results show that the
electron whistler instability grows much faster than the proton mirror
instability and quickly consumes the electron free energy, so that there is no
electron temperature anisotropy left to significantly impact the evolution of
the proton mirror instability."	arxiv
17	"We compute single inclusive hadron production in proton-proton and
proton-nucleus collisions consistently within the CGC framework. The parameters
in the calculations are obtained from electron-proton DIS and standard nuclear
geometry. We obtain a good description of the DIS data without an anomalous
dimension in the initial condition of the BK evolution and get a good agreement
with the available single inclusive proton-proton and proton-nucleus data."	arxiv

19	"Respiration in bacteria involves a sequence of energetically-coupled electron
and proton transfers creating an electrochemical gradient of protons (a
proton-motive force) across the inner bacterial membrane. With a simple kinetic
model we analyze a redox loop mechanism of proton-motive force generation
mediated by a molecular shuttle diffusing inside the membrane. This model,
which includes six electron-binding and two proton-binding sites, reflects the
main features of nitrate respiration in E. coli bacteria. We describe the time
evolution of the proton translocation process. We find that the electron-proton
electrostatic coupling on the shuttle plays a significant role in the process
of energy conversion between electron and proton components. We determine the
conditions where the redox loop mechanism is able to translocate protons
against the transmembrane voltage gradient above 200 mV with a thermodynamic
efficiency of about 37%, in the physiologically important range of temperatures
from 250 to 350 K."	arxiv
